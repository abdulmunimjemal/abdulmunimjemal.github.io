Hi, I’m Abdulmunim Jundurahman Jemal—a Software Engineer with a passion for AI-driven innovation. My expertise spans NLP, speech processing, and neuro-symbolic AI, where I’ve translated complex concepts into real-world impact. From creating intuitive speech-based language learning apps to developing machine translation systems, I enjoy tackling challenges that push the boundaries of technology.

My journey includes research at iCog Labs and working on transformative projects with SMARTi Co. in Japan. These experiences have shaped my problem-solving mindset and deepened my commitment to designing AI solutions that make a difference.

**Current Interests:**
  - Efficient NLP
  - Model quantization for resource-constrained environments
  - AI localization for global accessibility
  - Multi Modality
