I'm Abdulmunim Jundurahman Jemal, a Software Engineer specializing in AI. I have a strong background in NLP, speech processing, and some experience neuro-symbolic AI research, with hands-on experience in developing real-world applications such as speech-based language learning apps, machine translation systems, and advanced AI pipelines.

Currently, I'm a Software Engineer (AI) at Amaz√©thu, focusing on company-specific AI solutions. I've also collaborated on research at iCog Labs and worked on impactful projects during my time at SMARTi Co. in Japan. With a top CGPA in Software Engineering at Addis Ababa University, I combine a strong academic foundation with practical expertise.
